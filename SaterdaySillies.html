        <p class="standard">The Sunday Sillies are a small series that I try to make a gag a week. If I don't post one, just know that I'm probably doing something in relation to school. But I will try to stock pile a few in case I can't upload one that week. Each little bit will come out on Saterday (no duh). The time which they are put online doesn't matter. Now, here are three comics for your enjoyment! (ignore the tapas.io logo, that's where they were originaly uploaded. Go check me out if you want.)

          <p class="standard">This one was made out of rage when a {unspecified internet provider company name here}, decided it was a good idea to set a really low limit on crap. Sadly, this is the end of the three comics, expect more from Saterday Sillies soon!
