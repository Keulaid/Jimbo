            <p class="standard">  This is the very first "blog post on my website. Right now it's in very early development, and I have a lot of plans for what I want to do for my website. I will have several comics here, and I will have this blog. Hopefully I can finish this website, and make some posts. Something I want to do, is make an email subscription system. It might be automated, but I might have to do some other work around for this. And when I say, "it's early in development, I mean it. Because this is entirly hard coded into the website, and making a new post would be by manually making another window outline for the post. This will likely be updated, however, right now that is not the case.
